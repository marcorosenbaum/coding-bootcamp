            Hi there, my name is Marco. I worked 9 years in a big port in
            Germany as a technician. One year after I finished my studies in
            technical engineering, I started to travel around the world. I saw
            amazing nature and made great new friends in different countries and
            from different cultures. Also I became a magician in solving
            stressfull situations that just occur out of nowhere while you are
            traveling foreign countries.<br />
            Currently I am in the process of becoming a
            <i>Junior Frontend Developer</i>. Therefore I am undergoing further
            training at <i>Coding Bootcamps EU</i>.

              After working three years as a technician at
              <abbr title="Eurogate Technical Services GmbH">EGTS</abbr>, I got
              the team leader position. <br />In that position I was responsible
              for the work of multiple small teams of technicians. Also I had to
              report to our customers and I was responsible for the organisation
              with our subcontractors.

              During my journey in New Zealand I worked for a company that
              installed solar power systems on roofs of residential and
              comerical buildings. <br />
              Because of my previous experience and my qualification as an
              electrical engineer I directly started to work as the team leader
              of the solar installtion team. <br />
              Some of my responsibilitys were to teach my co-workers how to
              install the solar systems, organise all the material needed for
              the jobs and to get the jobs done in time with my team.
